title: "A Hidden Risk of strict: false and Object Spreads in TypeScript"

In our TypeScript projects, we've to keep `"strict": false` in our `tsconfig.json` due to legacy reasons. Our codebase dates back to around 2016, and over
the years we've accumulated a variety of dependencies â€” some of which arenâ€™t compatible with strict mode.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "strict": false
  }
}
```

One lesser-known downside of disabling strict mode is that it can mask subtle issues â€” especially when working with object spreads (`...`). Here's a simplified
example from a car configuration domain to illustrate the problem.

We define some basic types:

```typescript
type Engine = 'combustion' | 'hydrogen';

type Car = {
  name: string;
  color: 'blue' | 'red' | 'green' | 'white';
  engine: Engine;
  manyMoreConfigOptions: string;
}
```

Now letâ€™s define two preconfigured cars:

```typescript
const preconfiguredCar1: Car = {
  name: 'Renault Scenic Hydro',
  color: 'blue',
  engine: 'hydrogen',
  manyMoreConfigOptions: 'polar white, 210 PS, 4WD, 0-100 in 3.5s, 0 emissions'
}

const preconfiguredCar2: Car = {
  color: 'red',
  name: 'Ford Ranger',
  engine: 'combustion',
  manyMoreConfigOptions: 'dark, 550 PS, 4WD, 0-100 in 3.5s, 20 litres/100km'
}
```

Next we try to build our dream car:

```typescript
const dreamCar: Car = {
  color: 'white',
  engine: 'electric',
  ...preconfiguredCar2,
}
```
At this point, we believe weâ€™ve created an electric car. But when we try to charge it:

```typescript
superCharger.charge(boughtCar, 100);
```
ðŸ’¥ Boom. We've just tried to supercharge a combustion engine.

## What went wrong?

The issue lies in the order of property assignment during object spreading. The `engine: 'electric'` assignment was silently overwritten by `...preconfiguredCar2`, which sets the engine back to `'combustion'`.TypeScript simply ignores that assignment with `strict: false`.

As a result, there was no compiler warning, and we ended up with a car that didnâ€™t match our expectations.

Interestingly, if the preconfigured car hadnâ€™t included an `engine` property at all â€” or if we had assigned `engine: 'electric'` after the spread, the compiler would have caught the type error. This shows that developers canâ€™t always rely on the intuitive mental model that explicitly typed objects will trigger type errors reliably. With `strict: false`, the reality is more nuanced: whether a type error surfaces may depend on subtle implementation details like property order or presence.
